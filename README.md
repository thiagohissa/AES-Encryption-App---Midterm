## Synopsis

This encryption app allows users to send AES encrypted messages! The app was built on Objective-C and it has Advanced Encryption Standard - AES - built in (no CocoaPods). The app also allows users to insert/save hidden messages within photos.

## Motivation

I created this app because I wanted to give the users a way to send secure messages without depending on the security of apps such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Gmail, etc... 

## Framework

For this project I worked with Apple's security framework.
